Disney Fairies is a Disney franchise created in 2005. The franchise is built around the character of Tinker Bell from Disney's 1953 animated film Peter Pan, subsequently adopted as a mascot for the company. In addition to the fictional fairy character created by J. M. Barrie, the franchise introduces many new characters, and expands substantially upon the limited information the author gave about the fairies and their home of Neverland. The characters are referred to within stories as "Neverland fairies". The franchise includes children's books and other merchandise, a web site, and the computer-animated Tinker Bell film series, featuring the character and several of the Disney fairies as supporting and recurring characters. In Barrie's 1902 novel The Little White Bird, in which he introduced the mythos of Peter Pan and the fairies, he wrote, "When the first baby laughed for the first time, his laugh broke into a million pieces, and they all went skipping about. That was the beginning of fairies."[1] The Disney Fairies are based on a similar idea: every time a newborn baby laughs for the first time, that laugh travels out into the world, and those that make their way to Neverland turn into a Never fairy. The fairies generally reside in the Home Tree, a towering, massive tree located in the very heart of Pixie Hollow in Neverland. Various groups of fairies work and live nearby as well. Most of the fairy characters are young and female, but older, taller, and male fairy characters are also included. The males are sometimes referred to as "sparrow men", though the term "fairies" is used to refer to both female and male fairy characters. TinkerBell: Tinker Bell, a.k.a."Tink", is the fairy we all know and love - spunky, rebellious, impatient, impulsive, determined, persistent, temperamental... yet charming and lovable. She has a talent for pots and pans, a love of "lost things", and is braver than most fairies when it comes to getting close to humans. She tends to blame things on other people when she's frustrated, even if it is her fault. Of course, her temper can often get the better of her, but she's always a selfless and dedicated friend when the chips are down.Tinker Bell loves challenging work, and especially loves anything made of metal Ã¢â‚¬â€? her workshop is even a human tea kettle. She is generally a hard worker, but occasionally enjoys playing games like fairy tag. Before the books started, Tinker Bell had spent a long time away from pots and pans to be with Peter Pan. However, when Peter brought Wendy (whom Tinker Bell refers to as "the Wendy") to Never Land, Tinker Bell was heartbroken and went back to Pixie Hollow after the adventure with the Darling children was over. (The Trouble With Tink).  Rosetta: Rosetta is a garden talent fairy who is gentle and well-mannered, but also has a quick wit and a ton of charm. Rosetta shares a sassy streak with Tinker Bell. She always tries to look her best and loves giving beauty tips and makeovers to her friends, flowers and animals. She speaks in a thick Southern drawl, which makes you wonder if the baby from which she was laughed up from was a baby southern belle from the southern states of the U.S. Fairies never age, of course, but since Rosetta arrived in Pixie Hollow before most of her friends, she is presumed to be a little wiser than the others. It is revealed in Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue that she dislikes mud, despite being a garden fairy. She tends to become guilty of judging a book by its cover. She once became smitten by an ice-talent sparrowman named Sled. SilverMist: She is a water-talented fairy who is best described as sweet, silly, and sympathetic. Her sympathetic personality can be seen at many situations, such like when Terence is angry with Tink in Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure. She is always ready to lend an ear to a fairy friend in need and sometimes gives them good advice and sometimes not. But she usually gives more good advice than not. She's a really good fairy to be friends with.Silvermist has a delightfully offbeat and upbeat way of looking at everything. Very much a free spirit, she often listens to her heart more than her head. That's why she's sometimes doing something silly. She's an easygoing soul who is eager to please and makes friends easily. Her sense of loyalty is unmatched, and rubs off on Tink. Silvermist was born on the 16th of December, as Disney said her birthday is the same as the garden fairy Rosetta's.Silvermist's guilty pleasure is listening to rumors and gossip from the babbling brook. In Silvermist and The Ladybug Curse, it is mentioned that Sil is the only fairy in Pixie Hollow who doesn't believe in curses or things like that.
